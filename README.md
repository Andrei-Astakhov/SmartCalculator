# SmartCalculator

A  project (challenging) for JBA's **Kotlin Core** track: https://hyperskill.org/projects/88?track=18

A **graduate** project (hard) for JBA's **Kotlin Developer** track: https://hyperskill.org/projects/88?track=3

Apart from writing a useful program (everyone uses calculators!), 
you will learn a lot about lists, stacks, strings, and queues.
You will also get closer experience with 2 important data structures:
the stack and the queue. You will also gain firsthand experience with the BigInteger class.
